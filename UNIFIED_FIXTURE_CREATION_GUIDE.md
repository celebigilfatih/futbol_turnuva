2. Select the tournament from the dropdown menu
3. Review tournament information:

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Default Rank Matchups

Each final stage has default crossover matchups:

| Final Stage | Home Team | Away Team |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Gold (🥇) | Group A - 1st | Group B - 2nd |
| Silver (🥈) | Group A - 3rd | Group B - 4th |
| Bronze (🥉) | Group A - 5th | Group B - 6th |
| Prestige (⭐) | Group A - 7th | Group B - 8th |

### Mutation Chaining

The system uses sequential API calls to ensure reliability:

```typescript
// 1. Create group matches first
await generateGroupFixtureMutation.mutateAsync();

// 2. Then create crossover finals (if configured)
if (includeFinals && crossoverMatches.length > 0) {
  await createCrossoverMutation.mutateAsync();
}
```

### Match Data Structure

Each crossover match includes:
- **Stage**: Type of final (gold_final, silver_final, etc.)
- **Label**: Custom display name
- **Home Team**: Team ID, rank, and group
- **Away Team**: Team ID, rank, and group  
- **Date**: Match date and time
- **Field**: Field number

## 🎯 Benefits Over Previous Approach

2. ❌ Create group matches
3. ❌ Navigate to tournament detail
4. ❌ Click "Crossover Finals" button
5. ❌ Configure finals on separate page
6. ❌ Save finals separately

### New Approach (Unified)
1. ✅ Go to fixture page
2. ✅ Select tournament + optional finals

## 🚀 Best Practices

1. **Review Tournament Info**: Always check that your tournament has the correct teams before generating fixtures

2. **Use Defaults When Possible**: The default rank matchups follow standard tournament formats

3. **Customize When Needed**: Feel free to adjust ranks and groups for special tournament formats

4. **Skip Finals If Uncertain**: You can always add finals later using the standalone crossover page

5. **Check Field Availability**: Ensure you have enough fields for the scheduled matches

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Turnuva seçilmelidir" Error
- Make sure you've selected a tournament from the dropdown

### "En az 2 takım gereklidir" Error  
- The tournament must have at least 2 teams to create fixtures

### "Crossover maçları yapılandırılmalıdır" Error
- You selected finals but didn't configure any final stages
- Either select at least one final stage or uncheck the finals option

### Teams Not Showing in Finals
- Make sure group matches have been played and teams have standings
- The crossover page fetches actual standings data

## 📱 Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Clear visual feedback for selections
- Progress indicators for loading states

## 🎓 Alternative Method

If you prefer the old workflow or need to modify finals after creation:

1. Create group fixtures first (without finals checkbox)
2. Go to **Tournament Detail** page
3. Click **"Crossover Finals"** button
4. Configure finals on the dedicated page

This provides the same functionality but in separate steps.

## 📝 Summary

The unified fixture creation system makes tournament management faster and more intuitive by:

- Combining all fixture creation in one place
- Providing clear visual progress
- Offering flexible final stage configuration
- Using reliable sequential creation
- Reducing navigation and clicks
